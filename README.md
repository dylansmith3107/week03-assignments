Reflection

Required
🎯 What requirements did you achieve?

I believe that all required goals have been achieved.

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

Did not achieve any reacher goals.

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

Some of the reacher goals seemed possible within my current skill level, however I did not leave enough time to figure them out and use the help given to me, which seems to be my biggest issue so far.

Optional
🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

Some feedback on general efficiency of my code (e.g. anything that could have made things more automated / less code in general)

What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?
What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
What went really well and what could have gone better?
